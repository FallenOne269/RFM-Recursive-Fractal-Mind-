# RFAI System Setup Report

This report documents the environment preparation and validation steps executed in this workspace.

## Environment Preparation
- Created an isolated Python virtual environment (`python3 -m venv .venv`).
- Installed system dependencies from `requirements.txt` using the virtual environment's pip.
- Ran `install.py` from within the package directory, which verified imports and generated the sample configuration at `config/my_config.json`.

## Example Execution
- Executed `python examples/basic_usage.py` to demonstrate typical initialization, task processing, and performance reporting outputs.

## Test Suite
- Invoked `python tests/test_rfai.py`; all 11 tests completed successfully, covering initialization, fractal processing, swarm coordination, quantum routines, performance evaluation, and state persistence behaviors.

## Notes
- The install script's interactive prompt was answered with `y` to run the automated unit tests.
- No additional configuration changes were required beyond the generated sample configuration.

# Recursive Fractal Intelligence Models (RFIM)

An evolving architecture of adaptive recursive AI systems inspired by fractal structures, quantum cognition, and self-referential meta-learning.

## Core Components
- **AMIFS** – Adaptive Multiscale Iterated Function Systems
- **DFE** – Dynamic Fractal Encoding
- **RSA** – Recursive Structural Adaptation
- **Semantic Nodes** – Goal-oriented symbolic agents

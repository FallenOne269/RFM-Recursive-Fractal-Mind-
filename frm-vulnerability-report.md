- Create evolution rate limiting

## Testing Methodology

The assessment utilized a comprehensive simulation framework testing:
- **Basic Functionality**: Query processing, system metrics, multi-modal operations
- **Error Handling**: Malformed inputs, concurrent processing, memory exhaustion
- **Recursive Reasoning**: Convergence analysis, stability testing, performance degradation
- **Security & Safety**: Ethical alignment, adversarial resistance, resource protection

## Recommendations for Production Readiness

### Must Fix Before Deployment

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Fractal Recursive Mind demonstrates strong foundational capabilities but requires critical security and stability improvements before production deployment. The high divergence rate in recursive reasoning and security vulnerabilities present significant risks that must be addressed.

**Deployment Recommendation: NOT READY** - Critical issues must be resolved first.

**Estimated Timeline to Production Readiness: 4-6 weeks** with focused development on identified critical issues.
